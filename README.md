# Spam-Email-Detector

Spam Email Detector detect unsolicited, unwanted, and virus-infested email (called spam) and stop it from getting into email inboxes. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use spam filters to make sure they aren't distributing spam.

It is a program used to prevent those messages from getting to a user's inbox. Like other types of filtering programs, a spam filter looks for specific criteria on which to base its judgments.
